Projects

*  the size of the title of the project is not resizable.  
    * When you type a title thatâ€™s outside the borders of the input box you cant see anything beyond the very few first letters of the word at maximised display. In minimised form you only see few letters of the first words

Education
* description (maybe all description input fields)
    * They lack basic input formatting such as font sizes- bullet points makes it harder to try and list the modules for the degree done.
    * Display after the save shows as one long paragraph. Losing any formatting or blank spaces used to try to format a reasonable display
