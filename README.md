# Profiles app feedback

1. Allow for lists to be inputted or created.

2. When bullet points are added, they don't appear on the document as a formatted list, just a paragraph with some bullet points in the middle.

3. Allow for longer certification titles.

4. Text boxes for titles of certifications need to be larger to be able to see all or at least most of what has been entered.

5. Have a section for the initial information such as summary, degree and stream (maybe all in the same section) for consistency.

6. When trying to submit my profile from draft to pending, the app said that there was an error. When I recreated the profile and saved it as pending first, It again came up with an error. It saved it as pending this time so I am not sure if an error occurred at all.
