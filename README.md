* Make course text limit bigger  
* Have a selection where you could choose if you have a uni degree or not  
* after creating a project have a button to quickly add another one instead of going all the way back to the projects page. - or just send back to the projects page instead.  
* ADD edit button next to destroy as clicking the name isn't intuitive and it doesn't look like a link thought it was just colored text. so instead just have: Destroy | edit  
* have the description box to auto expand, don't like the look of it being 2 line and I have to scroll. even when I have half of the screen empty bellow the descrption box.  
* when in mobile view, have log-out on the same line as the hamburger glyphicon, show the name only when ther nav bar is expanded. this is because the name takes up space which makes it look like you have 2 navbars.  
* add a feature where you could order your projects.  
* ... add a correct character count to description... make it clear it counts the title too.  

### Hanad Ahmed:  
What I felt could be improved is that in the summary the character count could be increased as there was only 600 character available and that is including spaces and full stops, commas and so-forth.

Another thing which i felt could be improved was in education the next box after institution which was course only allowed you to put in one course at a time. So if you wanted to put in your educational history your high school history you would need to list out every single subject as you did many different course whilst in high school and filling in the exact same thing but changing the courses ten times is not very effective nor efficient.

Lastly, i didn't understand why the profile page had to be the last thing to be filled out. Usually you would fill out the summary and move your way forward to employment history and so forth. Having it this way makes it difficult for the user as there isn't any helpful popup boxes telling you to complete the other sections first.

Projects

*  the size of the title of the project is not resizable.  
    * When you type a title thatâ€™s outside the borders of the input box you cant see anything beyond the very few first letters of the word at maximised display. In minimised form you only see few letters of the first words

Education
* description (maybe all description input fields)
    * They lack basic input formatting such as font sizes- bullet points makes it harder to try and list the modules for the degree done.
    * Display after the save shows as one long paragraph. Losing any formatting or blank spaces used to try to format a reasonable display

*  It's simple and easy to use, but not very well designed. 
*  Instructions are not very detailed i.e. on the Education section, it should be specified what type/level of educations should be provided.
*   Profile isn't very well-formatted.
*   No formatting options, even the custom section is not customisable i.e. you should at least be able to change text sizes.
*   In the responsive mode, the Profile page isn't very well displayed. The summary section should be cut off, and only the first few lines should be displayed as it doesn't look very good overall.
*   The way the "Approved Profiles," "Pending Profiles," "Rejected Profiles," and "Draft Profiles" are listed isn't a very good design. Maybe have them in a drop-down menu option somewhere visible, like on the same line as Profile but set to the right?
