What I felt could be improved is that in the summary the character count could be increased as there was only 600 character available and that is including spaces and full stops, commas and so-forth.

Another thing which i felt could be improved was in education the next box after instution which was course only allowed you to put in one course at a time. So if you wanted to put in your educational history your high school history you would need to list out every single subject as you did many different course whilst in high school and filling in the exact same thing but changing the courses ten times is not very effective nor efficient.

Lastly i didnt understand why the profile page had to be the last thing to be filled out. Usually you would fill out the summary and move your way forward to employment history and so forth. Having it this way makes it difficult for the user as there isn't any helpful popup boxes telling you to complete the other sections first.

Projects

*  the size of the title of the project is not resizable.  
    * When you type a title thatâ€™s outside the borders of the input box you cant see anything beyond the very few first letters of the word at maximised display. In minimised form you only see few letters of the first words

Education
* description (maybe all description input fields)
    * They lack basic input formatting such as font sizes- bullet points makes it harder to try and list the modules for the degree done.
    * Display after the save shows as one long paragraph. Losing any formatting or blank spaces used to try to format a reasonable display
